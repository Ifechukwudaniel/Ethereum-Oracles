# Ethereum Oracles

Welcome to the Ethereum Oracles project! In this project, we will be exploring different types of Ethereum oracles, including inbound, outbound, consensus, and tokenization oracles. We will provide detailed code examples and simple projects to demonstrate how each type of oracle works.

### Please note that I cannot be held responsible for any loss of funds resulting from the use of these contracts. They are intended for educational purposes only and have not been audited

Each folder in this project contains a readme that explains the different types of oracles and provides code examples for each type.

For flexibility, we will be using a range of tools,

- Next, React, Vite: These are frontend frameworks that will be used in the project to build the user interface for the dApp.

- Foundry, Hardhat, Truffle: These are backend frameworks used for the development and deployment of smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

- Scaffold Eth 2: This is a preconfigured set of smart contracts and front-end code that streamlines the development process for dApps.

The document explains how each of these frameworks will be used in the project to develop Ethereum oracles.

Our goal doing this is to expose as many development tools as possible and to show that the framework is just a tool it can be implemented in may ways - nothing more.

Thank you for joining us on this journey!
